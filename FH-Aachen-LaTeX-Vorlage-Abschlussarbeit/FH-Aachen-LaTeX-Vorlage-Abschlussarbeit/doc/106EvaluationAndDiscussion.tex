 -	However, after a certain period, one of the signals ceased functioning, resulting in a persistent display of the value "false". Therefore, it was necessary to measure the current in order to ascertain the location of the failure. It was observed that a short circuit occurred on the printed circuit board (PCB) during the measurement process. The probable rationale pertains to an inadvertent connection between two 24-volt sources through the utilization of a multimeter.  Subsequent to the incident, retrieval of the signals from the sewing machine was rendered unfeasible. A decision was made to simulate the OPC UA server and generate test data that would emulate the standard sewing process. The decision was made to implement the system in a manner that would allow for the subsequent connection of the sewing machine to the data processing and analytics system following the installation of a new PCB.
