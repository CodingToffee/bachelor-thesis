\subsection{Industrial IoT Architectures and Patterns}
\addtocontents{toc}{\vspace{0.8cm}}
Due to the requirement that the solution be developed utilizing IoT technologies and is set within a production context, a review of Industrial IoT (IIoT) architectures and patterns was conducted. The Industrial Internet Reference Architecture (IIRA) \cite{IIRA} serves as a comprehensive framework, offering valuable insights into various architectural models and design patterns relevant to this domain. This reference architecture describes the following patterns: IoT Component Capability Pattern, Three-Tier Architecture Pattern, Gateway-Mediated Edge Connectivity and Management architecture pattern, Digital Twin Core as a Middleware Architecture Pattern, Layered Databus Architecture Pattern, System-of-Systems Orchestrator Architecture Pattern. Of these patterns only the first two are applicable within the scope of this work. Therefore the other ones will only be described on the surface.
