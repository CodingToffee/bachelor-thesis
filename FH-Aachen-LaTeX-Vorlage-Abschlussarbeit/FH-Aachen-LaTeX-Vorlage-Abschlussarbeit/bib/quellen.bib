Now a day's garments manufacturing companies are trying to develop their current production system and situation and continuously looking for new production tools and techniques in order to keep swiftness with the rapid changes of trend in consumers of apparel products. To deal with the recent problems \& challenges industries have to improve production efficiency \& productivity; ensuring proper quality requirements. There is no doubt that sewing section in an apparel industry is the most momentous and teeming department that plays a vital role in the whole firm. To improve the existing situation of this section and increasing productivity training program and sewing section line balancing based on worker capacity are very effective technique. To enhance operational efficiency, the organization set the training program and provide the training to employees means top to floor management and workers, where the training topics are selected quality policy, department wise goal \& designation wise job responsibility, which can increase their efficiency and productivity in completing their daily work tasks. In capacity study, Standard Minute Value (SMV) has been calculated for each operation or job. Based on this technique each operator capacity is measured and balanced to eliminate the bottlenecks. Here, by applying these techniques significant improvements in the sewing section have been achieved such as SMV, man power, bottleneck, production/hour, line efficiency, DHU, OLE and OEE. The findings can be extended to similar garments factory in the future.},

  abstract = {In the textile supply chain, the apparel manufacturing industry heavily relies on energy consumption (EC), contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Understanding and optimizing energy usage in apparel manufacturing is crucial for sustainable and energy-efficient manufacturing. The EC in the industrial sewing operations is directly linked with sewing parameters, including fabric seam length, standard sewing speed, and stitching time. In general, the carbon footprint of an apparel industry is measured by considering the standard minute value (SMV) and specific energy consumption (SEC). However, these metrics include non-productive time and do not accurately measure actual EC or assess the industry's carbon footprint. To address these limitations, this case study tackles this technical issue by calculating the stitching time of an industrial sewing machine based on its actual EC derived from the sewing machine's motor power. This study employs EC modeling for industrial sewing parameters, including fabric seam length, standard sewing speed, and stitching time. This proposed model utilizes real-time data collected during the garment-making process, including fabric spreading, cutting, sewing, and ironing. The study allocates eleven sewing machines for a specific garment style to stitch a basic knit fabric t-shirt. The total EC for the entire garment-making (t-shirt) process at a single line is 0.1052 kWh, equivalent to 59.97\,g of CO2 emissions (Bangladesh's CO2/kWh emission factor). This study explores that a direct-drive servo motor consumes approximately five times less than its maximum motor load power, making it more energy-efficient than other sewing machines. Therefore, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of EC modeling by incorporating industrial sewing parameters and selecting energy-efficient sewing machines to reduce carbon footprints and enhance environmental sustainability in the apparel manufacturing industry.},

A real-time variant current drawn by the motor is recorded at a sampling rate of 3.125 kS/s. The time signal is transformed into frequency spectrum that has peaks at specific frequencies related to needle penetrating fabrics. The proposed technique can mark out different denim fabric properties, mainly the fabric type and thickness. Increasing the fabric weight from 302.7 to 463.73~g/m2 and thickness from 1 to 8 plies appear as a linear shift in the frequency peaks towards lower values within a range of frequencies between 1170 and 1300~Hz. The frequency shifts by almost -1 Hz for every 20~g/m2 increase in the fabric weight while it shifts by almost -11~Hz per fabric ply increment. The correlation coefficient between the frequency shift and the number of fabric plies is calculated to be 0.998. On the other hand, frequency shifts toward higher frequency values by up to~+52~Hz when different chemical treatments are applied to the fabric samples. The measured data is verified by comparing them to similar data obtained using L\&M. The results of these two measurements were highly correlated with correlation coefficients of up to 0.91. The obtained results nominates that the proposed technique can be used as a real-time fabric detector for sewing machines.},

It is a distributed discrete event simulator based on the easy re-composition of resources in the production layout and on the availability of intelligent process management and control modules. The simulator has been applied to optimise the production of children's garments.

Within this context, the aim of this paper was the development of a software product based on fuzzy logic to schedule the replacement of the needles of the automated sewing machines based on their condition monitoring. The research was carried out on an automated sewing machine that operated at the recommended working speed of 3500 stitches/minute. The sewing material was polyester and NM 80 sewing needles were used. Vibration measurement was performed using the Top Lab-GBDT-L device, while the Center 322 sonometer was employed to measure the level of noise. The integrated software environment R was employed to develop the software product. This software allows the establishment of the time when the replacement of these needles should be done taking into account their noise level and vibrations amplitude. An example demonstrates the effectiveness of the software product for the replacement of the needles of automated sewing machines.},

Operation in potentially insecure environments, limited processing capability of the IoT devices and unreliable connectivity create the need of suitable Device Management (DM) solutions. But with the IoT being complex and diverse, the criteria for finding the right DM solution differ depending on the application-specific requirements of the given IoT system. In this paper, we develop a rating system for IoT DM solutions, which can be easily adapted. The criteria are represented with the FCAPS and the life cycle management models. Additionally, we conduct an evaluation of open source IoT platforms in contrast to commercial solutions.},

However, SMEs in this sector face significant operational challenges, including inefficient machine setup, high rates of rework, frequent breakdowns, and excessive sewing times due to lack of standardized processes. Addressing these issues is essential to enhance their competitiveness and sustainability. The proposed model integrates Lean Manufacturing and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) tools, such as 5S, Standardized Work, SMED, and Autonomous Maintenance, aiming to optimize production processes, reduce waste, and improve operational efficiency. This approach targeted deficiencies in machine setup, operational errors, and inadequate maintenance practices prevalent in the sector. The implementation of the model demonstrated significant improvements. Operational efficiency increased by 32.01\%, defective product rates decreased by 29.81\%, and setup times were reduced by 27.26\%. These results were achieved through the systematic application of Lean and TPM principles, which streamlined processes, minimized downtime, and enhanced overall productivity. The research's impact extends beyond operational improvements, contributing to the academic literature by filling a knowledge gap in the application of Lean and TPM tools in textile SMEs. Socioeconomically, the model promotes job creation, preserves cultural traditions, and enhances the competitiveness of SMEs, fostering economic growth in the region.},

To this end, this paper attempts to develop a performance evaluation for open source IoT platforms to reduce the complexity of the selection process. In particular, the paper evaluates the scalability (in terms of throughput and average response time) and stability (in terms of resource utilization and robustness) of the ThingsBoard and SiteWhere platforms.

  abstract = {IoT devices are becoming more prevalent yearly due to their relatively low cost and high maintainability. Their use cases are often varied-from industry (e.g., devices intended for quality control) to their application in smart cities, where they can help supervise day-to-day operations. With the increase in popularity comes the need to effectively store, query and process the data produced by such devices. This problem can seem relatively easy at first glance, but often, the solutions are not as straightforward. In real-world applications, multiple device types are needed to accomplish each task. This typically results in large streams of incoming data, each with its own structure and data representation. Due to the large amounts of devices, it may be necessary to distribute the workload or use serverless computing to tackle fluctuations in incoming requests. This paper provides a study of some options that can be used to achieve this goal, focusing on the efficiency and ease of use of both SQL and NoSQL databases currently available regarding deployment on both local devices and serverless functions like AWS Lambda. Document or relational databases are often used to store data from such devices. However, features of Time Series databases could be used to improve the entire system's performance and reduce storage requirements. One of the systems that could benefit from this improvement is a Smart City system developed by Logimic. The cost of the proposed smart city platform is essential because a high running cost can result in the system being more expensive than the cost reduction from using efficient IoT devices.},

  abstract = {Total quality management (TQM) is a methodical strategy to minimize defects through six processes including choosing the manufacturer, gathering information, identifying the issues, analyzing the current situation, and coming up with solutions, putting the plan into action, data collection, and result analysis. The study investigates how quality, productivity, and cost aspects of a sewing line can be improved by implementing (TQM) approach in an apparel manufacturing industry in Bangladesh. This research concentrates on reducing four primary types of faults in the sewing department of DMC Apparels Ltd., such as uncut thread, up-down, broken stitch, and joint stitch. Proper information on several stitching errors was provided by the operators and helpers and those are used to assess the study in the next step. Performing the Pareto analysis and histograms to identify the primary concerns are part of the analyzing process. Moreover, using the 10 TQM pillars, the implementation step entails establishing the TQM mindset in the sewing line of the apparel industry. Several data-gathering methods are utilized to analyze primary data throughout the study's final phase. To analyze the acquired data, Microsoft Excel was employed. The percentage of defect per hundred unit was decreased by 1.51\% after optimization, as the recommended solutions' impact on the defect level in the section was found to be quite significant. Significant parameters such as efficiency, quality, and cost aspect were analyzed and showed positive changes after implementing the TQM approach. The new technical layout also allows for the saving of five employees and a 3,000-min labor expense reduction. Finally, the research was completed by analyzing the basic pitch time graph and calculating the overall equipment effectiveness.},

LS of each operator was then classified and LD of each process was analyzed in terms of working time and quality. Finally, the resulting LS and LD weight factors considered to optimize the subject garment production line were compared against those proposed by experts. The LS weight factor proposed by the experts was {\textasciitilde}15\% less than that indicated by the experimental results, whereas the LD weight factor proposed by the experts was {\textasciitilde}15\%--40\% greater than that indicated by the experimental results.

The amount of electric current used in the sewing work was measured, and the measured data was transmitted to a server using Wi-Fi communication. The analysis of the data was conducted through the Symbolic Aggregate approximation (SAX) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) methods. The daily workload of each worker derived from the system developed through this study showed an error rate of 8\% compared to the actual workload, and the time measured by the sensor was different from the time measured by a manager using a stopwatch. These differences are considered to be due to measurement errors in the stopwatch, human noise from the measurer and the operator, and the relatively few samples relative to the total workload. The IoT-based power monitoring and work measurement system for sewing work developed through this study can be applied to smart garment manufacturing factories at an acceptable cost level, while SMEs can realise high recognition rates and semi-real-time monitoring.},

In modern manufacturing systems, KPIs are defined as a set of metrics to reflect operation performance, such as efficiency, throughput, availability, from productivity, quality and maintenance perspectives. Through continuous monitoring and measurement of KPIs, meaningful quantification and identification of different aspects of operation activities can be obtained, which enable and direct CI efforts. A set of 34 KPIs has been introduced in ISO 22400. However, the KPIs in a manufacturing system are not independent, and they may have intrinsic mutual relationships. The goal of this paper is to introduce a multi-level structure for identification and analysis of KPIs and their intrinsic relationships in production systems. Specifically, through such a hierarchical structure, we define and layer KPIs into levels of basic KPIs, comprehensive KPIs and their supporting metrics, and use it to investigate the relationships and dependencies between KPIs. Such a study can provide a useful tool for manufacturing engineers and managers to measure and utilize KPIs for CI.},

The information exchanged in IoT may be relatively small, but the bandwidth and energy used by these devices become significant as their numbers grow. Therefore, it is important to achieve the most efficient communication between the devices involved. A key factor in this is the selection of appropriate communication protocols that will best suit the applications needs. Standard protocols used in the Internet cannot offer good performance and efficiency for IoT sensors and devices. The task of selecting a protocol for data communication in IoT requires good knowledge and understanding of their performance and characteristics.

By analyzing the cycle time, it is possible to estimate the type of operation a worker is performing. The ability to calculate accurate cycle time and to manage a large volume of data is the advantage of this system. Establishing an accurate cycle time of all operations would be of great help in improving the production process, capacity planning, line efficiency, and labor cost calculation.

Three techniques have been developed in the sewing machine modification technology to assist the smarting and sewing process of the sewing machine. Three kinds of developed technology are a bobbin remaining amount detecting technique, stitch length control, and monitoring techniques. As a result of step-by-step technology development to realize CPS finally, it is a partial technology development of automation through some modification of sewing machine.

We hypothesize that open source IoTs benefits small and medium sized (SME) manufacturing companies to help them tackle economical and technical barriers for technology adoption at factory floors. This research reviews the state of the art of open-source hardware and software and identifies the challenges of open-source IoT by compiling scientific literature and relevant online resources. The methodology is twofold: (i) we use a grey literature review including online information, and (ii) we complement the analysis by a structured keyword search using IEEE scientific repository. The study finds that open source is and will be an essential part of developing Industry 4.0 solutions and its integral constituent, Industrial Internet of Things systems (IIoT). However, there are challenges to overcome, such as interoperability and reliability.},

  abstract = {This paper represents the use of some tools and techniques for improving apparel sewing section efficiency throughout the production process. Now a day's apparel manufacturing industries are trying to develop their current production system and situation and continuously looking for new production tools and techniques in order to keep swiftness with the rapid changes of trend in consumers of apparel products. To deal with the recent problems \& challenges industries have to improve production efficiency \& productivity; reduce lead time, ensuring proper quality requirements. There is no doubt that sewing section in an apparel industry is the most momentous and teeming department that plays a vital role in the whole firm. To improve the existing situation of this section and increasing productivity time study is a very effective technique. In time study, Standard Minute Value (SMV) has been calculated for each operation or job. Based on this technique each operators capacity is measured and balanced to eliminate the bottlenecks. Here, by applying these techniques significant improvements in the sewing section have been achieved such as SMV, man power, bottle neck, capacity achievable, production/hr, performance rating, balance \% and line efficiency. The findings can be extended to similar apparel industries in future. General overviews to these works are presented in this paper.},

  abstract = {The garment factories focus on improving their production systems by involving innovative and advanced production methods and/or techniques to cope with fast-changing trends. Accordingly, this study aims to establish the standard allowed minutes (SAMs) and sewing efficiencies for Tanzania's sewing industry, thus improving the production processes.,The research deployed a quantitative method. A stopwatch measured each operation for shirts and trousers to compute SAMs and efficiency. The shirt manufacturing processes involved 40 operations. Ten measurements were taken from different SL and LL industries operators for each operation. The trouser comprised 42 operations with 10 measurements taken from a different operator at the same garment factories for each operation.,SAMs for shirts at SL and LL factories were 29 and 31\,min, respectively, while trousers were 30 and 34\,min. The sewing efficiencies for shirts at both SL and LL factories were 83.98\% and 81.93\%, respectively. Similarly, the sewing efficiencies for trousers at both SL and LL factories were 81.25\% and 80.95\%, respectively.,Since SAMs results are not established through literature rather a quantitative approach, the findings thus place crucial information for similar factories to benchmark from. Such information are crucial as factories could increase productivity and operational efficiency, reduce costs and non-value adding activities and estimate lead times. Notwithstanding the findings gathered, the study only established SAMs for two garments.,Although the garment industry has been developing over the years, this study was probably among the first studies in Tanzania that established SAMs. Theoretical underpinnings indicate that the factories use the experience to assemble garments, thus the need for this study.},

One of the main aspects that hamper the large-scale development of IoT-based systems is the lack of interoperability. IoT Platforms aim to solve this issue by providing a uniform interface to access data from heterogeneous sources. However, integrating new protocols and applications can impose additional overhead, hindering the platform's overall performance and scalability. This study provides an insight into the trade-off between interoperability and performance of IoT platforms. First, we present a qualitative analysis of three open-source platforms - FIWARE, ThingsBoard, and Konker - analyzing their interoperability features. Second, we conduct a performance evaluation emulating two IoT-based environments -- smart cities and smart health -- to understand each platform's scalability, response time, and computer resource usage. Finally, we analyze the possible trade-offs between interoperability features and scalability based on the qualitative and quantitative analysis. The results show that interoperability features do not have a direct impact on the performance of the platform.},

In near future, IoT will have applications in various domains and these applications are going to produce tremendous amount of data. With the continuous generation of heterogeneous data, problem arises to store, transfer \& manage the data efficiently. Traditional database systems used Structured Query Language (SQL) database which has supported all the user requirements along with simplicity, robustness, flexibility, scalability, performance. But the main limitation they are facing is their static schema which is making RDBMS not suitable for IoT applications. On the other hand, NoSQL databases emerging in market have claimed to perform better than SQL database. The NoSQL databases are non-relational, schema free, no joins, easy replication support, horizontally scalable, etc. Does NoSQL perform better than SQL in all application scenarios? An effort to answer the same has been made in this paper. This paper compares SQL and NoSQL databases for a small scale IoT application of water sprinkler system and investigates whether NoSQL performs better than SQL in different scenarios.},

By using Key Performance Indicators, a company can establish baseline figures against a number of important areas. They can be considered like a health check on a company or a diagnosis of where a company can improve its performance. The definition of what they are and how they are measured does not change often, but Key Performance Indicators may change as the organisation's goals change. In this paper we present and discuss the way to establish Key Performance Indicators to evaluate the production effectiveness of garment companies. The KPIs are being tested in several garment companies in Albania and actually implemented in 25 companies.},

  abstract = {During this work an in depth analysis of existing data collection and recording solutions have been made. The analysis includes methods used in the manufacturing industry to collect information, and how they can be implemented in the sewing industry. The structure of a PFAFF 951 lockstitch sewing machine has been analysed to better understand the working principles of the sewing machine and existing solutions of sewing machine state monitoring have been reviewed. The acquired knowledge of the structure of a lockstitch sewing machine and possible monitoring solutions applied in the industry have been combined in effort to create a simple, yet versatile monitoring and recording system for sewing station data collection. In effort to select the most compatible sensors that would provide the monitoring and recording system with the most representative data, a sensor analysis and comparison has been done. The found sensors have been integrated into a monitoring system and verified by a higher or equal accuracy class instrument to prove their accuracy and reliability of the retrieved data. To integrate recording capabilities into the created monitoring system a Raspberry Pi 3B+ micro-computer has been implemented as the main data collection server. The collection of different sensor data retrieved from the Raspberry Pi 3B+ has been analysed and compared on the same real-time axis. The comparison consists of different action recognition from the retrieved data. It has been found that the most appropriate sensors to depict sewing machine state are current sensors. The possibility of integrating a non-complex data collection system into an existing sewing machine, could allow smaller scale manufacturers to implement big business methods such as LEAN and 6{$\sigma$} to increase efficiency of their production process.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a developed real-time monitoring and control system using Internet of Things (IoT) incorporated Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) supported by machines learning algorithms. The system focuses at meeting core issues and questions in terms of productivity, reliability and timeliness within evolving settings. The current paper contributes to the ongoing research and development in the area of IoT and WSN to enable, always-on real-time data gathering from a variety of discrete sensors which is invaluable for various applications including industrial, environmental and smart city applications. The heart of the system is based on the idea of utilising machine learning methods to acquire and elaborate sensor signals. More specifically, the deep learning models that are used include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks as well as Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for predictive analytics, as well as anomaly detection. The work also entails a comparison of the system performance based on energy consumption and other factors such as latency, packet delivery ratio and even the accuracy of the predictions made by the system. The findings suggest improved utilisation within substantial ranges; decreased energy use by 30 per cent or more. 7\%, latency decrease by 33. Although achieving this was accompanied by an increased data packet loss rate to 3\%, the overall packet delivery ratio was boosted to 98\%. Additionally, the system established overall accuracy rate of 95\% with negligible error percentage. In conclusion, this research proves the applicability of incorporating the IoT and the advanced machine learning methods in the real-time monitoring and control systems development to overcome cases of low efficiency and reduced performance in numerous real-world applications..},

  abstract = {The birth of mass production started in the early 1900s. The manufacturing industries were transformed from mechanization to digitalization with the help of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Now, the advancement of ICT and the Internet of Things has enabled smart manufacturing or Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 refers to the various technologies that are transforming the way we work in manufacturing industries such as Internet of Things, cloud, big data, AI, robotics, blockchain, autonomous vehicles, enterprise software, etc. Additionally, the Industry 4.0 concept refers to new production patterns involving new technologies, manufacturing factors, and workforce organization. It changes the production process and creates a highly efficient production system that reduces production costs and improves product quality. The concept of Industry 4.0 is relatively new; there is high uncertainty, lack of knowledge and limited publication about the performance measurement and quality management with respect to Industry 4.0. Conversely, manufacturing companies are still struggling to understand the variety of Industry 4.0 technologies. Industrial standards are used to measure performance and manage the quality of the product and services. In order to fill this gap, our study focuses on how the manufacturing industries use different industrial standards to measure performance and manage the quality of the product and services. This paper reviews the current methods, industrial standards, key performance indicators (KPIs) used for performance measurement systems in data-driven Industry 4.0, and the case studies to understand how smart manufacturing companies are taking advantage of Industry 4.0. Furthermore, this article discusses the digitalization of quality called Quality 4.0, research challenges and opportunities in data-driven Industry 4.0 are discussed.},

Experimental outcomes indicate that under high-concurrency IoT workloads, MongoDB outperforms InfluxDB in scalability, with latency falling to 0.003720 seconds at 50 concurrency, compared to InfluxDB's 0.003374 seconds. InfluxDB shows better initial memory efficiency but struggles with CPU demand, spiking at 607.45\% growth in utilization. MongoDB, despite higher memory use, remains stable in latency, showcasing better resource management with a lower CPU growth rate of 144.66\%. These findings provide a framework for selecting appropriate database solutions in the IoT context.},

However, the development of IoT applications still faces many challenges, such as handling unstructured data, intelligent analytics, connectivity, compatibility and interoperability, integration, and data security and privacy. In this paper, first, a real-time monitoring system is proposed based on opensource platform (called BKThings) and long-range (LoRa) communication technology. Specifically, a LoRa gateway prototype is implemented to collect, store and forward monitored data from the IoT devices. In addition, LoRa end devices are developed, where data calibrations on the low-cost sensors to accurately measure environmental and gas air parameters are integrated. Second, an opensource based IoT platform functional architecture is developed. The implementation includes main functionalists of a typical IoT platform such as user management, device registration, monitoring, connectivity, data acquisition, processing, storage, and visualization on the dashboards. The achieved results demonstrate that the tested implementation of the opensource IoT platform and the LoRa IoT gateway were suitable and scalable for sensing environmental parameters in certain data visualization.},

As IoT adoption continues accelerating across domains, understanding the land-scape of mature open source platforms is important for guiding technology selection and evolution. Several studies have compared open source and proprietary IoT platforms in terms of different capabilities. However, there has been limited research specifically targeting leading open source IoT platforms that are hosted on developer communities like GitHub. In this paper, we compare the most popular open source IoT platforms on GitHub in terms of activity metrics and popularity indicators. We also identify the main features and technical capa-bilities implemented across the top five starred open source IoT platforms on GitHub based on a systematic review of their docu-mentation. Our results show that: 1) Open source IoT platforms on GitHub exhibit diverse technical capabilities, yet share core features fo-cused on device management and data visualization, 2) ThingBoard platform emerges as a leader of the open-source IoT platforms not only in terms of popularity metrics and popularity indicators, but also in terms of a broad range of features and technical capabilities, 3) Platforms specialised in industrial IoT, such as Industial-IoT and United manufacturing hub, display the best health scores and ratios of open and closed issues, and 4) OpenRemote platform capabili-ties are rich but focused on the support and management of smart environments.},

Currently, the entire cycle time counting operation is manually carried out, leading to inefficiencies in strengthening the operational level observations and the inability to identify the non-value addition activities of the operations. The cycle time capturing module is designed to capture events from operation lines to visualize real-time dashboards. Dashboards are displayed in front of each factory line to give performance alerts to machine operators when necessary. In addition, gathered data is integrated into the cloud platform, which will provide data analytics. The module's four main components include the mobile application, which captures cycle time from the user-end, business administration application designed to get the business and planned information to the system, dashboard and the fog node. The proposed system potentially improves the real-time decision-making process by providing real-time alerts and real-time analytics. Furthermore, it promotes the production level efficiency and effectiveness by supporting critical key performance indicators (KPI) to drive continuous improvements in production.},
