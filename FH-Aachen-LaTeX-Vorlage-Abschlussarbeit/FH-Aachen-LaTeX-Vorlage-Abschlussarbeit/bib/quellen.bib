  abstract = {This case study represents the use of some tools and techniques for improving sewing section efficiency, productivity, defects per hundred units (DHU), overall labor effectiveness, overall equipment effectiveness throughout the production process. Now a day's garments manufacturing companies are trying to develop their current production system and situation and continuously looking for new production tools and techniques in order to keep swiftness with the rapid changes of trend in consumers of apparel products. To deal with the recent problems \& challenges industries have to improve production efficiency \& productivity; ensuring proper quality requirements. There is no doubt that sewing section in an apparel industry is the most momentous and teeming department that plays a vital role in the whole firm. To improve the existing situation of this section and increasing productivity training program and sewing section line balancing based on worker capacity are very effective technique. To enhance operational efficiency, the organization set the training program and provide the training to employees means top to floor management and workers, where the training topics are selected quality policy, department wise goal \& designation wise job responsibility, which can increase their efficiency and productivity in completing their daily work tasks. In capacity study, Standard Minute Value (SMV) has been calculated for each operation or job. Based on this technique each operator capacity is measured and balanced to eliminate the bottlenecks. Here, by applying these techniques significant improvements in the sewing section have been achieved such as SMV, man power, bottleneck, production/hour, line efficiency, DHU, OLE and OEE. The findings can be extended to similar garments factory in the future.},

The petabytes of data generated by telemetry sensors are already used for statistical analysis or the creation of prediction models used in various applications in the area of smart cities, smart building, smart health, smart energy, etc. On the other hand, the expansion of IoT forced the need of more standardized approaches such the ones used in industrial automation. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), as part of Industry 4.0 concept, promotes the cyber physical systems (CPS) as sensors and actuators that will build the modern automation world in and out of the factories. This article studies the IIoT reference architectures and the existing open source IoT platforms for proposing an integrated architecture for installing IIoT infrastructure that can collect and analyze big volume of data, easy and with low cost. The approach is evaluated in a smart building scenario.},

  abstract = {In the textile supply chain, the apparel manufacturing industry heavily relies on energy consumption (EC), contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Understanding and optimizing energy usage in apparel manufacturing is crucial for sustainable and energy-efficient manufacturing. The EC in the industrial sewing operations is directly linked with sewing parameters, including fabric seam length, standard sewing speed, and stitching time. In general, the carbon footprint of an apparel industry is measured by considering the standard minute value (SMV) and specific energy consumption (SEC). However, these metrics include non-productive time and do not accurately measure actual EC or assess the industry's carbon footprint. To address these limitations, this case study tackles this technical issue by calculating the stitching time of an industrial sewing machine based on its actual EC derived from the sewing machine's motor power. This study employs EC modeling for industrial sewing parameters, including fabric seam length, standard sewing speed, and stitching time. This proposed model utilizes real-time data collected during the garment-making process, including fabric spreading, cutting, sewing, and ironing. The study allocates eleven sewing machines for a specific garment style to stitch a basic knit fabric t-shirt. The total EC for the entire garment-making (t-shirt) process at a single line is 0.1052 kWh, equivalent to 59.97\,g of CO2 emissions (Bangladesh's CO2/kWh emission factor). This study explores that a direct-drive servo motor consumes approximately five times less than its maximum motor load power, making it more energy-efficient than other sewing machines. Therefore, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of EC modeling by incorporating industrial sewing parameters and selecting energy-efficient sewing machines to reduce carbon footprints and enhance environmental sustainability in the apparel manufacturing industry.},

A real-time variant current drawn by the motor is recorded at a sampling rate of 3.125 kS/s. The time signal is transformed into frequency spectrum that has peaks at specific frequencies related to needle penetrating fabrics. The proposed technique can mark out different denim fabric properties, mainly the fabric type and thickness. Increasing the fabric weight from 302.7 to 463.73~g/m2 and thickness from 1 to 8 plies appear as a linear shift in the frequency peaks towards lower values within a range of frequencies between 1170 and 1300~Hz. The frequency shifts by almost -1 Hz for every 20~g/m2 increase in the fabric weight while it shifts by almost -11~Hz per fabric ply increment. The correlation coefficient between the frequency shift and the number of fabric plies is calculated to be 0.998. On the other hand, frequency shifts toward higher frequency values by up to~+52~Hz when different chemical treatments are applied to the fabric samples. The measured data is verified by comparing them to similar data obtained using L\&M. The results of these two measurements were highly correlated with correlation coefficients of up to 0.91. The obtained results nominates that the proposed technique can be used as a real-time fabric detector for sewing machines.},

The paper develops a definition of IIoT and analyses related partial IoT taxonomies. It develops an analysis framework for IIoT that can be used to enumerate and characterise IIoT devices when studying system architectures and analysing security threats and vulnerabilities.

The automated sewing machines are state-of-the-art complex machines that operate at high speeds, where vibrations and noises are generated by their moving parts. The levels of vibrations and noises increase at the high-speed working regime and when some components are worn out. Within this context, the aim of this paper was the development of a software product based on fuzzy logic to schedule the replacement of the needles of the automated sewing machines based on their condition monitoring. The research was carried out on an automated sewing machine that operated at the recommended working speed of 3500 stitches/minute. The sewing material was polyester and NM 80 sewing needles were used. Vibration measurement was performed using the Top Lab-GBDT-L device, while the Center 322 sonometer was employed to measure the level of noise. The integrated software environment R was employed to develop the software product. This software allows the establishment of the time when the replacement of these needles should be done taking into account their noise level and vibrations amplitude. An example demonstrates the effectiveness of the software product for the replacement of the needles of automated sewing machines.},

However, SMEs in this sector face significant operational challenges, including inefficient machine setup, high rates of rework, frequent breakdowns, and excessive sewing times due to lack of standardized processes. Addressing these issues is essential to enhance their competitiveness and sustainability. The proposed model integrates Lean Manufacturing and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) tools, such as 5S, Standardized Work, SMED, and Autonomous Maintenance, aiming to optimize production processes, reduce waste, and improve operational efficiency. This approach targeted deficiencies in machine setup, operational errors, and inadequate maintenance practices prevalent in the sector. The implementation of the model demonstrated significant improvements. Operational efficiency increased by 32.01\%, defective product rates decreased by 29.81\%, and setup times were reduced by 27.26\%. These results were achieved through the systematic application of Lean and TPM principles, which streamlined processes, minimized downtime, and enhanced overall productivity. The research's impact extends beyond operational improvements, contributing to the academic literature by filling a knowledge gap in the application of Lean and TPM tools in textile SMEs. Socioeconomically, the model promotes job creation, preserves cultural traditions, and enhances the competitiveness of SMEs, fostering economic growth in the region.},

  abstract = {IoT platforms play a central role in IoT architecture; as they enable the development of services and applications by end users. More than 300 IoT platforms were reported in the literature. IoT platforms vary in their capabilities and features. Accordingly, Selecting between the various platforms can be troublesome. This is particularly true given the fact that no benchmark or systematic evaluation criteria currently exist to evaluate and compare various platforms. To this end, this paper attempts to develop a performance evaluation for open source IoT platforms to reduce the complexity of the selection process. In particular, the paper evaluates the scalability (in terms of throughput and average response time) and stability (in terms of resource utilization and robustness) of the ThingsBoard and SiteWhere platforms. The two platforms are evaluated under heavy load of sensor data readings.},

  abstract = {IoT devices are becoming more prevalent yearly due to their relatively low cost and high maintainability. Their use cases are often varied-from industry (e.g., devices intended for quality control) to their application in smart cities, where they can help supervise day-to-day operations. With the increase in popularity comes the need to effectively store, query and process the data produced by such devices. This problem can seem relatively easy at first glance, but often, the solutions are not as straightforward. In real-world applications, multiple device types are needed to accomplish each task. This typically results in large streams of incoming data, each with its own structure and data representation. Due to the large amounts of devices, it may be necessary to distribute the workload or use serverless computing to tackle fluctuations in incoming requests. This paper provides a study of some options that can be used to achieve this goal, focusing on the efficiency and ease of use of both SQL and NoSQL databases currently available regarding deployment on both local devices and serverless functions like AWS Lambda. Document or relational databases are often used to store data from such devices. However, features of Time Series databases could be used to improve the entire system's performance and reduce storage requirements. One of the systems that could benefit from this improvement is a Smart City system developed by Logimic. The cost of the proposed smart city platform is essential because a high running cost can result in the system being more expensive than the cost reduction from using efficient IoT devices.},

In modern manufacturing systems, KPIs are defined as a set of metrics to reflect operation performance, such as efficiency, throughput, availability, from productivity, quality and maintenance perspectives. Through continuous monitoring and measurement of KPIs, meaningful quantification and identification of different aspects of operation activities can be obtained, which enable and direct CI efforts. A set of 34 KPIs has been introduced in ISO 22400. However, the KPIs in a manufacturing system are not independent, and they may have intrinsic mutual relationships. The goal of this paper is to introduce a multi-level structure for identification and analysis of KPIs and their intrinsic relationships in production systems. Specifically, through such a hierarchical structure, we define and layer KPIs into levels of basic KPIs, comprehensive KPIs and their supporting metrics, and use it to investigate the relationships and dependencies between KPIs. Such a study can provide a useful tool for manufacturing engineers and managers to measure and utilize KPIs for CI.},

The information exchanged in IoT may be relatively small, but the bandwidth and energy used by these devices become significant as their numbers grow. Therefore, it is important to achieve the most efficient communication between the devices involved. A key factor in this is the selection of appropriate communication protocols that will best suit the applications needs. Standard protocols used in the Internet cannot offer good performance and efficiency for IoT sensors and devices. The task of selecting a protocol for data communication in IoT requires good knowledge and understanding of their performance and characteristics. This paper examines several popular data communication IoT protocols and compares them by using structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.},

This research reviews the state of the art of open-source hardware and software and identifies the challenges of open-source IoT by compiling scientific literature and relevant online resources. The methodology is twofold: (i) we use a grey literature review including online information, and (ii) we complement the analysis by a structured keyword search using IEEE scientific repository. The study finds that open source is and will be an essential part of developing Industry 4.0 solutions and its integral constituent, Industrial Internet of Things systems (IIoT).

One of the main aspects that hamper the large-scale development of IoT-based systems is the lack of interoperability. IoT Platforms aim to solve this issue by providing a uniform interface to access data from heterogeneous sources. However, integrating new protocols and applications can impose additional overhead, hindering the platform's overall performance and scalability. This study provides an insight into the trade-off between interoperability and performance of IoT platforms. First, we present a qualitative analysis of three open-source platforms - FIWARE, ThingsBoard, and Konker - analyzing their interoperability features. Second, we conduct a performance evaluation emulating two IoT-based environments -- smart cities and smart health -- to understand each platform's scalability, response time, and computer resource usage. Finally, we analyze the possible trade-offs between interoperability features and scalability based on the qualitative and quantitative analysis. The results show that interoperability features do not have a direct impact on the performance of the platform.},

In near future, IoT will have applications in various domains and these applications are going to produce tremendous amount of data. With the continuous generation of heterogeneous data, problem arises to store, transfer \& manage the data efficiently. Traditional database systems used Structured Query Language (SQL) database which has supported all the user requirements along with simplicity, robustness, flexibility, scalability, performance. But the main limitation they are facing is their static schema which is making RDBMS not suitable for IoT applications. On the other hand, NoSQL databases emerging in market have claimed to perform better than SQL database. The NoSQL databases are non-relational, schema free, no joins, easy replication support, horizontally scalable, etc. Does NoSQL perform better than SQL in all application scenarios? An effort to answer the same has been made in this paper. This paper compares SQL and NoSQL databases for a small scale IoT application of water sprinkler system and investigates whether NoSQL performs better than SQL in different scenarios.},

  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is an attractive part of our daily life. However, the development of IoT applications still faces many challenges, such as handling unstructured data, intelligent analytics, connectivity, compatibility and interoperability, integration, and data security and privacy. In this paper, first, a real-time monitoring system is proposed based on opensource platform (called BKThings) and long-range (LoRa) communication technology. Specifically, a LoRa gateway prototype is implemented to collect, store and forward monitored data from the IoT devices. In addition, LoRa end devices are developed, where data calibrations on the low-cost sensors to accurately measure environmental and gas air parameters are integrated. Second, an opensource based IoT platform functional architecture is developed. The implementation includes main functionalists of a typical IoT platform such as user management, device registration, monitoring, connectivity, data acquisition, processing, storage, and visualization on the dashboards. The achieved results demonstrate that the tested implementation of the opensource IoT platform and the LoRa IoT gateway were suitable and scalable for sensing environmental parameters in certain data visualization.},

  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) platforms have emerged as key enablers for connected device deployment, providing core infrastructure capabilities that can be customized and extended. As IoT adoption continues accelerating across domains, understanding the land-scape of mature open source platforms is important for guiding technology selection and evolution. Several studies have compared open source and proprietary IoT platforms in terms of different capabilities. However, there has been limited research specifically targeting leading open source IoT platforms that are hosted on developer communities like GitHub. In this paper, we compare the most popular open source IoT platforms on GitHub in terms of activity metrics and popularity indicators. We also identify the main features and technical capa-bilities implemented across the top five starred open source IoT platforms on GitHub based on a systematic review of their docu-mentation. Our results show that: 1) Open source IoT platforms on GitHub exhibit diverse technical capabilities, yet share core features fo-cused on device management and data visualization, 2) ThingBoard platform emerges as a leader of the open-source IoT platforms not only in terms of popularity metrics and popularity indicators, but also in terms of a broad range of features and technical capabilities, 3) Platforms specialised in industrial IoT, such as Industial-IoT and United manufacturing hub, display the best health scores and ratios of open and closed issues, and 4) OpenRemote platform capabili-ties are rich but focused on the support and management of smart environments.},
