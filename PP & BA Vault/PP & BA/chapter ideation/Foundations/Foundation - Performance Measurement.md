Performance Measurement in the textile production Industry is important due to high competition. It enables producers to identify potential bottlenecks, gives them better understanding over the process and therefore makes better resource allocation possible. /cite{alauddin}
The tools to carry out performance measurement are KPI's and Metrics. 
The team around \cite{kangHierarchicalStructureKey2016} from the National Institute of Standards and Technologie in the U.S. has worked out how the different kinds of KPI's and metrics that are being used in operation management and production based on the ISO 22400 are related to each other.
\\First there are the supporting elements which in this thesis will be called metrics because they describe the measured data that is needed to calculate the basic KPI's. The supporting elements are devided into the categories time and quantity.
Time elements measure the duration of different events. For example how long it takes to produce one piece of a product. Quantity elements on the other hand regard the amount of produced pieces for example.
\\There are also  maintenance elements which record information about problems with machines. Based on the supporting elements the basic KPI's can be calculated.  They are devided into Production, Quality and Maintenance KPI's.
The researchers also highlight the importance of comprehensive KPI's that offer a more expanding overview of the production. These are based upon basic KPI's and include for example OEE which is calculated by multiplying the KPI's availability, effectiveness, and quality ratio.
\For the sewing section of a textile production plant there are some intersections with the KPI's that the team around Kang has examined but also a few new ones where introduced. 
In the following these KPI's used specifically in the sewing section will be classified within the hierarchy of Kang et. al.




- further describe the kinds of elements
- Take sewing line specific elements and sort them related to these kinds
