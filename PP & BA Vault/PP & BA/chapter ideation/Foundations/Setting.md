The sewing machine is of type Brother UF-8910.It is part of a textile production line where a wristband is being produced. This wristband contains an RFID chip that can hold various information. For example it could be used to hold a personnel number and if scanned on a workplace the workplace would adjust to fit the worker. The production line is not intended for actual industrial-scale manufacturing, but rather serves as a model environment for workshop purposes. The sewing machine is part of the last station where the wristband is assembled. The process that the machine is used for is straight forward. It only needs to sew both ends of the open wristband together with one seam. The following figure illustrates this.
