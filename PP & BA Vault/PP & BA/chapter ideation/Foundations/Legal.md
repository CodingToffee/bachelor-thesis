- In Germany and the whole European Union personal rights regarding personal data have a high importance. Therefore it is important to give a brief overview over the regulations that need to be fulfilled by the proposed system. 
- (71)In the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union it is determined that it is not allowed to measure the performance of a worker automatically without any human intervention that produces legal effects. Though this is not the intend of the system, if the produced data would be traceable to a single worker, it could be abused to put pressure on the worker or to find reasons to fire him if his performance is to low. It also rules that a worker must be informed if any personal data is being collected. Personal data in the case of the system in question would be produced amounts traceable to individual workers.
  Another thing to consider is that according to the german "Betriebsverfassungsgesetz § 87 Mitbestimmungsrechte" the works council has co determination rights regarding systems that measure the performance of workers.
