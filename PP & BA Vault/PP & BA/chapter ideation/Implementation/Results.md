Extract measurable facts from your running system and present them in tables/figures. Do not argue or interpret in Results.

Concrete checklist you can fill now:

Dataset facts: days simulated, events/day, average sampling interval, percentage of time in each state, number of breaks/downtimes per day, random seeds used.

KPI tables: per-shift and per-day values for all computed elements; plus aggregated stats across randomized runs.

Performance: median and p95 latency, sustained throughput, CPU/RAM per container, Influx write success rate, task execution duration.

Reliability: total runtime, number of container restarts, health-check failures, watchdog activations.

Traceability: one 10â€“15 minute window showing raw signals, detected pattern intervals, and resulting KPI increments.
