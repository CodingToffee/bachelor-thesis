The whole setup of grafana happens in its web ui. 
The grafana dashboard consists of multiple panels which each hold a visualisation of a KPI. This can be a simple numeric value or different kinds of charts. The data for these visualisations is simply generated by writing a flux query within the grafana web ui. It can then be selected what kind of visualisation is desired. For the flux queries a connection to the Influx Database needs to be established. The configuration is straight forward. Only the IP adress, name of the organisation, default bucket, authentification details and the API token need to be provided.
