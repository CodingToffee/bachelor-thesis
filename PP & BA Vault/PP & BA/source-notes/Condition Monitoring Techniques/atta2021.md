It might be possible to make statements about the condition of the needle like level of dullness trough changes in the frequency of the current.

 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The proposed technique can mark out different denim fabric properties, mainly the fabric type and thickness.  Increasing the fabric weight from 302.7 to 463.73 g/m2 and thickness from 1 to 8 plies appear as a linear shift in the frequency peaks towards lower values within a range of frequencies between 1170 and 1300 Hz. The frequency shifts by almost 1 Hz for every 20 g/m2 increase in the fabric weight while it shifts by almost 11 Hz per fabric ply increment. The correlation coefficient between the frequency shift and the number of fabric plies is calculated to be 0.998."</mark> [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NCF9RCTI?page=1&annotation=YYLHB3SQ)
