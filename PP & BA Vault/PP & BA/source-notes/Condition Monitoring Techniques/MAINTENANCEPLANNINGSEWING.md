 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The noise levels of a new needle at the working speed of 200 stitches/minute and 4000 stitches/minute were measured. The noise levels for a fault needle at the same working speed of 200 stitches/minute, respectively 4000 stitches/minute were also measured. Using Fuzzy Logic Toolbox ™ module of Matlab®, a decision-making system for determining when replacement of the sewing needles of simple sewing machines should be performed was developed."</mark> [Page ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LAU6PWEW?page=&annotation=89NDZ3PN)
