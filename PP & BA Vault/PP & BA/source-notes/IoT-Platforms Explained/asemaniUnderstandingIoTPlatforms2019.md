 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The main characteristics of the commercial platforms are  classified into eight main categories3, which are 1)  connectivity/device management, 2) data storage and  management, 3) data analysis and visualization, 4) development tools and platforms, 5) edge/fog computing, 6)  integration and interoperation, 7) Service management, and 8)  auditing and payment."</mark> [Page 174](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YMRVAFF6?page=174&annotation=SPIPSFQZ) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Most of the open-source projects (mentioned in the  previous section) have focused on some specific aspect of the  central management services’ features, so that several opensource products should be integrated to deliver a proper IoT  platform."</mark> [Page 175](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YMRVAFF6?page=175&annotation=D2EBT9XL) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Based on Table IV, a few numbers of the mentioned open  source projects provides “edge/fog computing”, and “data  visualization”, also none of them delivers “service  management”. Therefore, it can be inferred the open source  IoT platforms have some gaps in delivering fog computing,  data visualization, and service management."</mark> [Page 175](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YMRVAFF6?page=175&annotation=B38XVP5A) 

Summarized capabilities by GPT 4.1
**Connectivity and Device Management:**  
IoT platforms establish and maintain stable connections with devices using various communication protocols, manage device status and configurations, handle software updates, and provide mechanisms for error reporting and self-healing.

**Data Storage, Management, Analysis, Visualization:**  
These platforms store large volumes of device-generated data (mainly in the cloud), process and analyze it using various analytics methods (including AI), and present insights visually on user dashboards to support decision-making.

**Development and Deployment Tools:**  
IoT platforms offer tools, APIs, and SDKs for developing and deploying device applications and vertical solutions, as well as APIs for accessing internal platform services and data.

**Auditing and Payment:**  
They provide auditing features and support pay-as-you-go financial transactions based on parameters like data or computing usage.

**Service Management:**  
Platforms enable management and control of IoT services, including resource usage, data access, and integration of basic services (like spatial services) to support various verticals and service creation.

**Integration:**  
IoT platforms integrate with other platforms, data sources, and clouds, allowing access to external services and data, which enhances analytics and scalability.

**Fog/Edge Computing:**  
They support distributed data storage and processing across cloud and fog resources, improving response times and reducing data transfer costs, but face challenges like interoperability, security, and managing heterogeneous devices.
