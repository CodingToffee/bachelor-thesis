**KPI’s Related to Sewing:**

**Line Wise Sewing Efficiency:** Activity makes the whole garments, so estimating sewing efficiency is an important factor for the garments industry. To know the line wise sewing efficiency we should to know the man to machine ratio. We need to maintain this ratio in order to achieve more efficiency.

**Manpower to machine ratio:** The ratio among manpower to machine is to be important to know. Every factory has self-recorded of these ratios to reduce manpower, keeping less helper with the best possible production outcome.

**Absenteeism:** Operator absenteeism affects sewing production, creates the bottleneck (Getting less output and consuming more time and hampering the overall production rate). Every factory target employee absenteeism rate is zero % but sometimes it may not possible to keep this percent.

**No of Style Change:** Style change effect on productivity, efficiency, and quality. So the garments manufacturer wants big lot order more rather than small quantity order for any lot so as to accept the order as per huge quantity.

**DHU:** Defect rates also a key point in garments manufacturing. The factory has to rework for repairing defects. The defect generation reduces the operator’s efficiency and we get less output. The factory wants to keep defects as low as possible for per hundred units

**Idle Time/Machine:** Idle time is also known as loss of time. For any type of reason, operators are not working and are considered to lose time. That is they are sitting idle having no work to do, example: Operators are waiting for pieces to come to sew. Common reasons for idle time are; using a new layout, machine trouble, no work, etc.
