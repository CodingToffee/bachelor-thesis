 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"To  survive in global competitive market most manufacturing companies focus their  manufacturing strategies on minimizing their production costs, increasing productivity,  improving product quality, resources utilization, and increasing customer satisfaction."</mark> [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=1&annotation=EDY46B4M) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"In manufacturing industry high productivity through appropriate distribution of these  resources and adequate operational procedures becomes a priority."</mark> [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=1&annotation=83AM8SH5) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The most  critical manufacturing process is sewing, as it generally involves a great number of  operations. Measurement performance is the first step that leads to control and  eventually to improve it."</mark> [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=1&annotation=VW3DUVIE) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"to correctly determine the profitability of the various product manufactured [1]."</mark> [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=1&annotation=J7K4KC9M) 
 
Measuring output helps to correctly calculate prices. Accurate measuring even more. [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=1&annotation=J7K4KC9M) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Performance measures are the life blood of organizations,  since without them no decisions can be made [2]. Measurement is the first step that  leads to control and eventually to improve."</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=2&annotation=VS2RZTI2) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"If you can’t measure something, you can’t  understand it. If you can’t understand it, you can’t control it, you can’t improve it [3]."</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=2&annotation=QANI9TCP) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-magenta">"Efficiency is the comparison of what is actually produced or performed with what can  be achieved with the same consumption of resources [4]."</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=2&annotation=TLWIUJX6) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-magenta">"Overall Labor Effectiveness  (OLE) measures the utilization, performance, and quality of the workforce and its  impact on productivity [5]."</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=2&annotation=4SZVI9LB) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-magenta">"OEE is usually formulated as a function of a number of  mutually exclusive components such as availability efficiency, performance efficiency,  and quality efficiency in order to quantify various types of productivity losses, such as  breakdown, setup and adjustment, idling and minor storage and quality defect and  rework [6]."</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=2&annotation=DDH44S85) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-magenta">"Productivity is measured by achievement toward established goals based on  relationships between inputs and outputs [7]."</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=3&annotation=3ZIAA654) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-magenta">"An operation is one of the steps in a process that must  be completed to convert materials into a finished garment."</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=3&annotation=IFAYSIRW) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-magenta">"Cycle time: Total time taken to do all works to complete one operation, i.e. time from  pick up part of first piece to next pick up of the next piece [12, 13]."</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=5&annotation=Y9KLRJ8G) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-magenta">"SMV (Standard minute value): The amount of time required to complete a specific  job or operation under existing condition, using the specified & standard method at a  standard pace when there is plenty of repetitive work [14].  Standard time = (Average observed time x Rating %) + Allowance %."</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=5&annotation=4Q8PA6Z3) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-magenta">"Allowance: Different types of allowances are allowed in apparel production floor. Such  as personal time allowance, Delay allowances, Fatigue allowances etc."</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=5&annotation=I6C3ANQB) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-magenta">"2.2.3 Efficiency  Efficiency is the comparison of what is actually produced or performed with what can  be achieved with the same consumption of resources [4]."</mark> [Page 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=5&annotation=5CA3GE9M) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-magenta">"As for example, Efficiency has been evaluated by measuring the following times for the  November, 2015 where total Produce minute = 21352252 minute and total available  minute = 57711780 minutes."</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=6&annotation=XXA6KKQL) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-magenta">"2.2.4 Defect per hundred units (DHU)  It means number of defects found or detected per hundred unit of garments. This is also  known as DPHU (Defects Per Hundred Units). DHU value is calculated using  following formula"</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=6&annotation=F6XKU8PH) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-magenta">"2.2.5 Overall labor effectiveness (OLE)  OLE is a key performance indicator (KPI) that measures the utilization, performance,  and quality of the workforce and its impact on productivity. OLE measures availability,  performance, and quality."</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=7&annotation=C3SWFPCA) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-magenta">"Availability – the percentage of time employees spend making effective contributions.  = Time operators are working productively / Time scheduled (2.5)  = (Available minute – Non-productive time) / Available time (2.6)"</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=7&annotation=N3A6N76H) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-magenta">"Performance = the amount of product delivered.  = Produce minute / (Available minute – Non-productive time) (2.7)"</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=7&annotation=IDG2UN6L) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-magenta">"Quality – the percentage of perfect or saleable product produced.  = Total good part / Total parts produced"</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=7&annotation=8G7RGX78) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-magenta">"2.2.6 Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE)  OEE quantifies how well a manufacturing unit performs relative to its designed  capacity, during the periods when it is scheduled to run [6]. OEE breaks the  performance of a manufacturing unit into three separate but measurable components:  Availability, Performance, and Quality. Each component points to an aspect of the  process that can be targeted for improvement."</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YRMH59AL?page=8&annotation=HXU9WI2D)
