 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The definition of what they are and how they are measured does not change often, but Key Performance Indicators may change as the organisation's goals change."</mark> [Page 62](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VNWU2BA?page=62&annotation=6YDXAMYM)

 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Some organisations prefer to register this information on a monthly basis instead of a weekly basis, but this is a long period because for the KPIs the action needs to be taken very quickly so that the impact is high."</mark> [Page 62](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VNWU2BA?page=62&annotation=78BZQHNN) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Every company/organisation that collects data applies three rules: 1. Only the registered data are to be collected. 2. No need to register the data if no action is to be undertaken later. 3. No need to analyse the data if no action will be undertaken."</mark> [Page 62](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VNWU2BA?page=62&annotation=TBPH5WSQ) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"As with all Management Information Systems, the accuracy of the data collected is very important."</mark> [Page 62](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VNWU2BA?page=62&annotation=ZV6DHXUK) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The KPIs give the results of the performance of a company for the previous week and provide indicators of where action needs to be taken to improve its future performance."</mark> [Page 62](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VNWU2BA?page=62&annotation=NX37E2U7) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"often success is simply the repeated achievement of some level of operational goal (zero defects, 10/10 customer satisfaction, etc.)."</mark> [Page 62](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VNWU2BA?page=62&annotation=TYGTS75X) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Because of the need to develop a good understanding of what is important, performance indicator selection is often closely associated with the use of various techniques to assess the present state of the business, and its key activities."</mark> [Page 62](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VNWU2BA?page=62&annotation=2C7VF2Y3) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The KPI report acts as a health check on the performance of the company by providing results in the following areas, which in turn leads to a diagnosis of what action needs to be taken to achieve improvements: Productivity - efficiency of the operators, including utilisation, Company structure – ratio of direct operators to indirect operators, Human resources – levels of absenteeism and labour turnover Efficient use of resources – fabric and trim utilisation, Costs – a comparison of the company’s Cost per Standard Hour and the Cost per Standard Hour received from the customer, Quality – Levels of Defects per Hundred Units (DHUs)."</mark> [Page 63](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VNWU2BA?page=63&annotation=DC8BQ6VH) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-magenta">"There are many reasons why the company should evaluate its production effectiveness: • To estimate how well it is performing, • To show how the managers should control the work of the operators, • To plan the budget: budgets are good means for improving performance, • To improve the operators’ performace, • To motivate the operators, • To promote, • To learn."</mark> [Page 63](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VNWU2BA?page=63&annotation=SATLYQSF) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Principles of evaluation of production effectiveness  • The establishment of baseline figures against a number of important areas. • The measurement of whole work (monitoring the operators). • If one does not measure the work how one can be informed where there is a need for improvement; how does one know where the operators and money should be allocated? • Non-measured work should be kept at a minimal level or avoided. • Monitoring the output each hour/each day. • Performance evaluation in terms of results is related to the work transformation from managers into an operational one. • Performance reporting and variations analysis should be regularly registered. • Regular reporting ensures that correcting actions are undertaken in good time • Correcting action is important for efficient managerial control"</mark> [Page 63](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2VNWU2BA?page=63&annotation=I6QHM6I3)
