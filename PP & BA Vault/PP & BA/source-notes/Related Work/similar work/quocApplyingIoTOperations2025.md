- Collection of data from industrial sewing machines through IoT
- proposes a data structure for integrating this information with the enterprise’s MIS system.
- the article proposes an automatic production planning method by applying the Real-RCPSP problem

The paper proposes an IoT-based system for industrial sewing production that collects real-time production data from sewing machines via IoT devices. This data is synchronized with the IoT device provider’s cloud server and then integrated into the enterprise’s Management Information System (MIS). The system includes a data structure for storing IoT-collected data within the MIS, enabling detailed monitoring and reporting of production progress. Additionally, the paper proposes an automatic production planning method using the Real-RCPSP problem combined with the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize resource allocation and production scheduling, thereby improving production efficiency and contract completion times. This integrated system supports real-time operations management and production planning in garment enterprises (from [page 1](da://viewer/dwa5r1lzs83ivkq6/1) to [page 8](da://viewer/dwa5r1lzs83ivkq6/8)).

**Architecture and Features**
- **IoT Device Deployment**: IoT devices are attached directly to industrial sewing machines to collect real-time data on production and machine operation ([page 3](da://viewer/dwa5r1lzs83ivkq6/3)).
    
- **Data Synchronization**: Data collected by IoT devices is synchronized in real-time to the IoT device provider’s Cloud server system ([page 3](da://viewer/dwa5r1lzs83ivkq6/3)).
    
- **Integration with MIS**: Data from the Cloud server is synchronized and integrated into the enterprise’s Management Information System (MIS) to combine IoT data with existing management data such as human resources, contracts, and costs ([page 3](da://viewer/dwa5r1lzs83ivkq6/3) to [page 4](da://viewer/dwa5r1lzs83ivkq6/4)).
    
- **Database Structure**: The MIS database includes tables for customers, contracts, products, staff, production plans, sewing lines, production progress, and devices to organize and store IoT data effectively ([page 5](da://viewer/dwa5r1lzs83ivkq6/5)).
    
- **Real-Time Monitoring and Reporting**: The integrated system synthesizes data into detailed reports and productivity charts to help managers monitor production progress and make timely decisions ([page 5](da://viewer/dwa5r1lzs83ivkq6/5)).
    
- **Automatic Production Planning**: The system applies the Real-RCPSP problem combined with the PSO algorithm to generate optimized production schedules based on contract data and resource constraints ([page 6](da://viewer/dwa5r1lzs83ivkq6/6) to [page 7](da://viewer/dwa5r1lzs83ivkq6/7)).
    
- **Optimization and Efficiency**: The automatic scheduling model reduces contract execution time and improves production efficiency and profitability ([page 7](da://viewer/dwa5r1lzs83ivkq6/7)).
    
- **Overall Architecture**: The architecture consists of IoT devices on sewing machines → Cloud server synchronization → Data transfer to enterprise MIS → Data integration and storage → Reporting and production planning modules ([page 3](da://viewer/dwa5r1lzs83ivkq6/3) to [page 5](da://viewer/dwa5r1lzs83ivkq6/5)).

**Results**
Then, the data is retrieved from the cloud server and synchronized into the enterprise’s Management Information System (MIS) to integrate with other business data such as human resources, contracts, and costs. This integration allows the enterprise to generate detailed and customized management reports for real-time monitoring and decision-making.

The paper reports that applying the Real-RCPSP problem combined with the PSO algorithm for automatic production planning in industrial sewing significantly improves contract completion times. Experimental results show reductions in execution time ranging from 5.05% to 31.54% compared to current practices. This improvement demonstrates that automatic scheduling through evolutionary methods optimizes resource allocation, reduces contract execution time, enhances production efficiency, lowers costs, and increases profits and competitiveness for garment companies. These results are detailed in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 4 on [page 6](da://viewer/dwa5r1lzs83ivkq6/6) to [page 7](da://viewer/dwa5r1lzs83ivkq6/7).

**Analytics**
Regarding analytics, the system synthesizes and analyzes production data stored in the MIS to generate detailed reports that help managers monitor real-time production progress and make timely decisions. Additionally, the paper applies the Real-RCPSP (Real Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem) model combined with the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to perform automatic production planning. This approach optimizes resource allocation and production scheduling, improving contract completion times and production efficiency (from [page 5](da://viewer/dwa5r1lzs83ivkq6/5) to [page 7](da://viewer/dwa5r1lzs83ivkq6/7)).
