**Architecture and Features**
The main features and architecture of the system proposed in this paper are centered on the development and integration of smart sensing and monitoring technologies for sewing machines, aimed at enabling smart factory implementation within the textile industry. The system is designed as part of a cyber-physical system (CPS) to automate and monitor the sewing process, which is traditionally labor-intensive. The key features and architectural components are as follows:

Main Features:

1. Bobbin Remaining Amount Detecting Technique: A device is developed to detect and indicate the remaining amount of under-thread (bobbin thread) in the sewing machine. This system uses sensors (such as a cylinder and position transmitter, and a photo sensor for bobbin rotation) to prevent defects caused by running out of thread and to alert operators in real time (from [page 2](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/2) to [page 3](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/3)).
2. Stitch Length Control: The system includes an automatic stitch control device that adjusts the number of stitches based on pre-entered information about the fabric being processed. This helps prevent operator errors and allows for product-specific stitch customization ([page 3](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/3)).
3. Monitoring Techniques: The system collects data from various sensors (under-thread detection, stitch control, etc.) and displays it in a monitoring system. This information is also transmitted to higher-level systems such as the POP (Point of Production) system, PDM (Product Data Management) system, and customer-linked systems, enabling real-time process monitoring and integration with broader manufacturing operations ([page 3](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/3)). System Architecture:

- The architecture is based on a CPS framework that connects different production streams (fabric, dyeing, sewing) through ICT and IoT technologies ([page 1](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/1)).
- The system integrates the ordering system, design automation, product information management, production information integration, and production equipment automation to enable high-throughput, high-productivity, and flexible manufacturing ([page 2](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/2)).
- The sewing machine is modified to include the developed sensing and control devices, with information flow structured so that sensor data is collected, processed, displayed, and transmitted to interconnected management systems (from [page 2](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/2) to [page 3](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/3)).
- The architecture supports real-time monitoring, automatic control, and data-driven decision-making, forming the basis for future smart sewing automation plants ([page 1](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/1) and [page 3](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/3)).

In summary, the proposed system features advanced sensing for thread management, automated stitch control, and comprehensive monitoring, all integrated within a CPS-based architecture to support smart manufacturing in textile production.

**Results**
- The study developed three key techniques for sewing machine modification to support the smarting and automation of the sewing process: a bobbin remaining amount detecting technique, stitch length control, and monitoring techniques ([page 1](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/1)).
- The bobbin remaining amount detecting device was successfully designed and implemented, using a combination of primary and secondary sensing methods to detect the residual under-thread and the bobbin rotation status, thereby reducing worker mistakes and product defects (from [page 1](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/1) to [page 2](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/2)).
- The stitch control device allows for automatic adjustment of the number of stitches based on the type of fabric being worked on, which helps prevent worker errors and enables recording and confirmation of the current work ([page 3](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/3)).
- The monitoring system collects information from the developed devices and transmits it to higher-level systems (POP, PDM, and customer-linked systems), facilitating the smartization of the sewing process ([page 3](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/3)).
- The developed technologies are expected to be used as foundational technologies for future smart sewing automation plant construction, contributing to the realization of a cyber-physical system (CPS) in textile manufacturing ([page 1](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/1) and [page 3](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/3)).

**Data Collection**
The system collects data from various sensors installed on the sewing machine. These include devices for detecting the remaining amount of under-thread (bobbin), monitoring bobbin rotation, and controlling stitch length. The sensors used include a cylinder (CXSM630) and a SMAT-8M sensor for position detection, as well as an Omron NPN type photo sensor (E3Z-LL61) for monitoring bobbin rotation. The collected data pertains to the status of the under-thread, bobbin rotation, and stitch parameters (from [page 2](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/2) to [page 3](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/3)).
    
**Data Analysis**
The system uses software algorithms to process the sensor data. For example, the under-thread residual sensing algorithm determines if the under-thread is insufficient and, if so, stops the machine operation immediately to prevent defects. The system also analyzes bobbin rotation to detect issues such as tangling or defects (from [page 2](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/2) to [page 3](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/3)).
    
**Data Visualization**
The information collected and analyzed by the sensors and algorithms is displayed in a monitoring system. This monitoring system presents real-time status updates to operators and is also linked to higher-level systems such as the POP (Point of Production) system, the PDM (Product Data Management) system, and customer-linked systems. This ensures that the data is not only visualized locally but also integrated into broader production management and customer information flows ([page 3](da://viewer/dfpx9f98up18s7db/3)).
