### Persistent Notes 
%% begin notes %% 
You can incorporate the given paper ("Key Performance Indicators in Cyber-Physical Production Systems" by Samir et al., 2018) into your related work section as a representative case study of KPI-based performance measurement in modern industrial environments. Here is how you could align it with the structure from _related-work-structure.docx_:

**Overview of Existing Performance Measurement Systems for Industrial Sewing Machines**  
The paper does not focus on sewing machines but provides a transferable methodology for KPI development in cyber-physical production systems. You could mention that while direct studies on sewing machines are rare, research from related domains (like the Scania pedal car assembly line) offers valuable insights.

**Performance Measurement in Broader Industrial Contexts**  
Summarize the case study:  
Samir et al. (2018) present a KPI system for a cyber-physical production environment at Scania, Sweden. The study describes the transition from manual to automated data collection using smart tools and PLCs, and the use of standards (ISA-95, ISO 22400) for KPI definition. The approach emphasizes real-time data acquisition, event-driven architectures, and the integration of smart tools for continuous improvement.

**Comparison of Approaches and Technologies**  
Highlight that the case study uses service-oriented and event-driven architectures, real-time data collection, and standardized KPI definitions. Compare this to other approaches (if available) in your section, noting the trend toward modular, flexible, and interoperable systems.

**Identified Gaps and Limitations in Existing Work**  
Point out that the case study focuses on a demonstrator line (not full-scale production) and does not address sewing machines specifically. Note that while the methodology is robust, adaptation to sewing machines may require consideration of domain-specific KPIs and integration challenges.

**How Your Work Differs / Advances the State of the Art**  
State that your work applies similar principles (real-time data, standardized KPIs, modular architecture) but tailors them to the specific requirements of industrial sewing machines. Emphasize any unique aspects, such as sewing-specific KPIs, integration with existing sewing machine controls, or usability improvements for operators.

Samir, K., Khabbazi, M.R., Maffei, A., & Onori, M.A. (2018). Key Performance Indicators in Cyber-Physical Production Systems. Procedia CIRP, 72, 498–502. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2018.03.036](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2018.03.036)

Key features include:

- Distributed Intelligent Units: The system is composed of many small, self-contained computational units, each with its own CPU, capable of performing independent computations and collaborating to achieve common goals. This design enhances expandability and flexibility ([page 2](da://viewer/djxsum3tckw35f3e/2)).
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA): The architecture encapsulates lower-level controls and enables interoperability between different units. SOA allows the use of various programming languages suited to specific tasks, improving speed and reliability ([page 2](da://viewer/djxsum3tckw35f3e/2)).
- Enterprise Service Bus (ESB): Communication between units is facilitated by an ESB, which manages message routing, security (encryption/decryption), logging, and transaction support. The ESB ensures safe and reliable interactions among services ([page 2](da://viewer/djxsum3tckw35f3e/2)).
- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA): To address communication delays in distributed systems, the architecture incorporates event-driven mechanisms. Events trigger services, enabling loosely coupled interactions where systems respond to notable occurrences without direct dependencies ([page 2](da://viewer/djxsum3tckw35f3e/2)).
- Standardization: The system leverages industrial standards such as ISA-95 and ISO 22400 to ensure uniformity in KPI definitions and facilitate automated interfaces between enterprise and control systems (from [page 2](da://viewer/djxsum3tckw35f3e/2) to [page 3](da://viewer/djxsum3tckw35f3e/3)).
- Real-Time Data Acquisition: The system integrates smart tools (e.g., power tools with PLCs) that provide real-time data, enabling direct access to operational information and supporting the calculation of various KPIs (from [page 3](da://viewer/djxsum3tckw35f3e/3) to [page 4](da://viewer/djxsum3tckw35f3e/4)).

In summary, the proposed architecture is a modular, service-oriented, and event-driven system that utilizes distributed intelligence and standardized KPI methodologies to enhance data acquisition, interoperability, and performance measurement in cyber-physical production environments (from [page 2](da://viewer/djxsum3tckw35f3e/2) to [page 4](da://viewer/djxsum3tckw35f3e/4)).
