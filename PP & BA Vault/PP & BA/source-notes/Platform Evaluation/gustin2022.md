 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Criterion 3: Operating costs  The cost of operation is often a decisive factor for the deployment of a solution in a company. Cost scaling is also an important factor as IoT devices continue to be added, especially in the IoT space. However, estimating costs for in-house hosting with open source SW is difficult because no information is provided on how resource utilization will behave. Therefore, only the consideration for 25 IoT devices is made (estimated size of our IoT system in the future). For the scoring, the monthly costs of the solution are divided into the ranges listed below (based on the cost range of the rated IoT platforms). The score is then calculated using fi = (1 − X). Thus, fewer points are awarded for higher costs.  • X = 0: 0 C • X = 0,1: >0 C - 33,33 C • X = 0,2: >33,33 C - 66,66 C • X = 0,3: >66,66 C - 100 C • X = 0,4: >100 C - 133,33 C • X = 0,5: >133,33 C - 166,66 C • X = 0,6: >166,66 C - 200 C • X = 0,7: >200 C - 233,33 C • X = 0,8: >233,33 C - 266,66 C • X = 0,9: >266,66 C - 300 • X = 1: >300 C"</mark> [Page 1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EHIWGCAP?page=1&annotation=44SRJ5S5)

 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Criterion 51: Completion of the server SW  A finished and installation-ready SW reduces the effort significantly, in contrast to SW of which only the source code is available. This would still have to be compiled, which in turn requires the installation of appropriate tools (if not already available). Docker images are a popular form of software deployment, as they also name the dependencies of the SW and install them automatically. If the software is provided as a Docker image it is scored with fi = 1. If only the source code is provided, a score of fi = 0 is assigned."</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EHIWGCAP?page=6&annotation=JSM22CH3) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Criterion 53: Development of the server-side application When implementing the application of error detection and alarm triggering, it is important to support the developers as much as possible. Programming aids such as SDKs facilitate the use of functions of the [1] platform. An integrated rule engine almost completely eliminates the need to write code and speeds up implementation through its visual configuration. If a rule engine is present, it is scored as fi = 1. If only SDKs for the development of an application are available, the score is fi = 0.5. Without assistance, the score is fi = 0."</mark> [Page 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EHIWGCAP?page=6&annotation=H8F2JYX6)
