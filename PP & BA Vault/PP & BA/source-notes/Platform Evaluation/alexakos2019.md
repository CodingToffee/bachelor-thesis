 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The Thingsboard [13] platform is the latest open source effort with active presence and support in the open source community. It can be considered as the most complete platform, since its free version satisfies the requirements of most properties, such as device management, collection, preprocessing, editing and graphical presentation of the data. It can be installed easily and it is easy to interconnect a new device since it is accompanied by a gateway that allows the two-way connection of devices with multiple communication protocols and message structure. Furthermore, it supports industrial protocols like the OPC-UA and Modbus. Finally, it provides a complete graphical environment with a decision engine that allows user and device feedback according to rules on data values."</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V3QKIKRS?page=3&annotation=G2LHIQMT)

 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The openHab [14] platform is the most mature work in the field of building automation using the Internet of Things. It is supported by a large community, which also helps in the development of plugins for interfacing with various commercial devices. Moreover, it fully supports all the basic data collection, processing and presentation functions. It lags behind others in installation and customization complexity, and in providing a friendly graphical environment. A multiplicity of communication protocols are supported via the existing plugins, yet industrial protocols are not supported. From a security standpoint, it does not support device authentication and graded access."</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V3QKIKRS?page=3&annotation=RMTVI9EQ) 
 
supported by large community. Lacks in good dashboard, customization, installation, security. [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V3QKIKRS?page=3&annotation=RMTVI9EQ)

 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The DeviceHive [15] platform is another attempt from the open source community. Its distinguishing feature is the provision of an SDK in several languages which enables the further extension of its functions. It does not support graphical data representation and data analysis for which a third-party application is required. The interconnection of a new device may pose serious difficulties due to the lack of built-in support of many known device interface protocols."</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V3QKIKRS?page=4&annotation=QEDYG5LP)

 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The KAA [16] platform is supported by a large group of developers but lacks recent updates. The platform supports specific data collection and storage functions. Data processing and graphical visualization are only supported by the commercial version."</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V3QKIKRS?page=4&annotation=UKQW8WA8)
