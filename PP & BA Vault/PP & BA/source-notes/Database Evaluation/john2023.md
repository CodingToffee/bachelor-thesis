 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"In this case, time series databases are directly optimized for work with time series, like the data from IoT sensors. The most popular of these databases is InfluxDB [28]. InfluxDB, similarly to many time series databases, uses delta encoding [29], which significantly reduces the size of numerical series, that contain intervals where the parameter value is similar."</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HXE3WKZP?page=2&annotation=CUIV2CFA)

 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"MongoDB and InfluxDB fared much better, providing significantly more performance than both DynamoDB and PostgreSQL."</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HXE3WKZP?page=3&annotation=G2AQNUUU) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The combination of performance and storage efficiency makes InfluxDB an interesting choice for smart city installations. Both MongoDB and InfluxDB show remarkable storage efficiency when compared to PostgreSQL. In the case of the 350 MB dataset, the total database size was 787 MB in the case of PostgreSQL, which is more than double the size of uncompressed MongoDB version 5 at 265 MB. InfluxDB was able to store the dataset on 69 MB."</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HXE3WKZP?page=4&annotation=ZJGJNE69)

 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"On the other hand, InfluxDB provides tools to easily request downsample data, such as Telegraf, Tasks, and MQTT plugins."</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HXE3WKZP?page=4&annotation=S9LEKIIW)
