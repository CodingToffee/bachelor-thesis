 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"This work compares the query performances and storage efficiencies of relational and time series databases, specifically focusing on system metric storage and visualization on Grafana using MySQL, InfluxDB, and Prometheus."</mark> [Page 1174](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67TISG9L?page=1174&annotation=8BYY9MJ3) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-red">"These databases are ideal for storing related single-time data points and support complex queries involving multiple tables through joins and aggregations. They ensure data integrity and consistency, making them suitable for transactional applications and scenarios where relationships between different data points are essential."</mark> [Page 1174](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67TISG9L?page=1174&annotation=QWRATCH8) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-green">"On the other hand, time series databases, such as InfluxDB and Prometheus, are specifically designed to handle data points associated with timestamps."</mark> [Page 1174](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67TISG9L?page=1174&annotation=YMQIPS3H) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-green">"Time series databases excel at handling large volumes of time-stamped data, making them ideal for monitoring systems, IoT applications, and real-time analytics."</mark> [Page 1174](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67TISG9L?page=1174&annotation=X44P5P5Z) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-green">"The main advantage of time series databases is their ability to perform high-speed read and write operations for time-stamped data."</mark> [Page 1174](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67TISG9L?page=1174&annotation=NQM857C9) 
 
 
 <mark class="hltr-green">"They are optimized for operations like downsampling, interpolation, and retention policies, which are crucial for managing long-term data storage. Furthermore, time series databases often include features for handling data compression and high cardinality, making them more efficient in terms of storage and performance compared to relational databases."</mark> [Page 1174](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/67TISG9L?page=1174&annotation=JK9PMBEC)
