 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Our analysis revealed that InfluxDB showed lower memory usage and comparable CPU utilization at lower concurrency levels. However, it encountered challenges with write operations, leading to latency spikes at higher concurrency levels. In contrast, MongoDB demonstrated stable latency and consistent CPU utilization, making it a reliable choice for intense workloads.  Based on our findings, we recommend InfluxDB for IoT applications with lower concurrency, considering its memory efficiency and reasonable CPU utilization. However, caution should be exercised when scaling up to higher concurrency levels due to potential write performance and latency stability issues. MongoDB, with its stable latency and CPU utilization, is a suitable option for handling intense workloads in IoT scenarios."</mark> [Page 42](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5AJCBMLN?page=42&annotation=TVPGI6I5)
