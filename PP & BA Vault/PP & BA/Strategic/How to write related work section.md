The problem here is likely deeper than just how to write a related work section. In order to publish a (good) scientific paper, you need to be able to compare your results to prior results---often directly and quantitatively in your experimental section.

If you already have prior methods that you are comparing to in your experimental section, then that's a good seed for your related work. Look at the papers describing those methods; look at papers that they cite and papers that cite them. By spending a few days wandering around in this web of literature, you are likely to be able to get a good sense of what else is out there and which of those pieces of work are most significant overall or most closely related to your own.

If you _don't_ have prior methods that you are comparing to, then you need to sit down with your professor and get some help. If you aren't comparing in some way, how can you establish that your work is a significant improvement worth publication?

### Tip no. 2
In the Related Works section, you should discuss briefly about published matter that technically _relates_ to your proposed work.

A short summary of what you can include (but not limited to) in the _Related Works_ section:

- Work that proposes a different method to solve the same problem.
- Work that uses the same proposed method to solve a different problem.
- A method that is similar to your method that solves a relatively similar problem.
- A discussion of a set of related problems that covers your problem domain.

### Structure of a Related Work Section

1. **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the scope of the literature review. State what topics you will cover and why they are relevant to your thesis.
2. **Thematic Grouping**: Organize the literature by themes or sub-topics. Avoid a simple chronological list. Group papers that discuss similar methodologies, findings, or problems.
    - For each theme, summarize the key contributions of relevant papers.
    - Identify common approaches, theories, or technologies.
    - Point out any contradictions, debates, or areas of disagreement among researchers.
3. **Critical Analysis**: Do not just summarize. Critically evaluate each source.
    - Assess the strengths and weaknesses of the research.
    - Discuss the methodologies used and their limitations.
    - Consider the relevance of the findings to your specific problem.
4. **Identify Gaps**: Clearly articulate what is missing in the existing literature.
    - Show how previous studies have not fully addressed your research question.
    - Highlight areas where current solutions are inadequate or could be improved.
    - This section directly leads to the justification of your own research.
5. **Connect to Your Research**: Explain how your thesis builds upon, extends, or challenges the existing work.
    - Position your research within the broader academic landscape.
    - State how your work will fill the identified gaps or offer a novel contribution.
6. **Conclusion**: Briefly summarize the main takeaways from the literature review and reiterate the significance of your research in light of the existing body of knowledge.

- organize the sources 
- what is the story of my thesis?
- related work and their limitations
- advantage of proposed solution and what is new about it

**Common Mistakes**
- setting the wrong expectations when pointing out what is missing in the related work
	- make sure to describe limitations with respect to the novelty of what i propose
- lack of focus
	- don't just list related work but give it a direction
- missing new / important papers

### How To Write An Exceptional Literature Review With AI [NEXT LEVEL Tactics]
- ask llm to create structure
- take sentences from sections and copy paste them into elicit
- take one paper thats more on the higher level and use it as a seed with litmaps you can find more other relevant papers that were cited or are citing
- in total get around 20 papers (phd)
- use docanalyzer.ai to answer the questions from the structure
